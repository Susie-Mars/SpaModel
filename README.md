I created Spa Model with the help of C#, CSS, HTML, MySQL and Bootstrap. Spa Model is a website that allows spas and individual licensed providers to offer free 
services for training purposes in their spa. Users can search posts based on the service they're looking for, and providers have the ability to login/register to 
create/edit/delete posts offering services. I used a MySQL database to store users login information, in addition to hashing passwords, and to also store posts created.

Enjoy!
